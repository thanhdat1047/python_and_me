# Try-Except
## The `try` block lets you test a block of code for errors.
## The `except` block lets you handle the error.
## The `else` block lets you execute code when there is no error.
## The `finally` block lets you execute code, regardless of the result of the try- and except blocks.

# Exception Handling
## Since the `try` block raises an error, the `except` block will be executed.

# Many Exceptions
## You can define as many exception blocks as you want, e.g. if you want to execute a special block of code for a special kind of error

# Else
## You can use the `else` keyword to define a block of code to be executed if no errors were raised

# Finally
## The finally block, if specified, will be executed regardless if the try block raises an error or not.


# Raise an exception
## As a Python developer you can choose to throw an exception if a condition occurs.
## To throw (or raise) an exception, use the raise keyword.
## The raise keyword is used to raise an exception.
