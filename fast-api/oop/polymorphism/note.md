### Python Polymorphism
The word "polymorphism" means "many forms", and in programming it refers to methods/functions/operators with the same name that can be executed on many objects or classes.

## Class Polymorphism
Polymorphism is often used in Class methods, where we can have multiple classes with the same method name.

## Inheritance Class Polymorphism
What about classes with child classes with the same name? We can use polymorphism there. 
Child classes inherits the properties and methods from the parent class, but can override them
