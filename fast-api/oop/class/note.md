### CLASS

## __inti__() method
To understand the meaning of classes we have to understand the built-in __init__() method.
All classes have a method called __init__(), which is always executed when the class is being initiated.
Use the __init__() method to assign values to object properties, or other operations that are necessary to do when the object is being created

Note: The __init__() method is called automatically every time the class is being used to create a new object.

## The self Parameter
Note: The self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class, and is used to access variables that belong to the class.

It does not have to be named self, you can call it whatever you like, but it has to be the first parameter of any function in the class

## Modify Object Properties
p1.age = 40

## Delete Object Properties
You can delete properties on objects by using the `del` keyword

## Delete Objects
You can delete objects by using the `del` keyword

## The pass Statement
class definitions cannot be empty, but if you for some reason have a class definition with no content, put in the pass statement to avoid getting an error.
