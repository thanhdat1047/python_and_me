### Python collections (Arrays)
## There are four collection data types in the Python

- List: is a collection which is ordered and changleable. Allows duplicate members
- Tuple: is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members
- Set: is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed. No duplicate members
- Dictionary: is a collection which is ordered** and changeable. No duplicate members
