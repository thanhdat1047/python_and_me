# Variables are containers for storing data values.

# Create variables
- Python has no command for declaring a variable.
- A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
"" x = 5 ""

# Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, 
# and can even change type after they have been set.
x = 4, x = "A"

# Casting
- If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.
x = str(3), y = int(3)

# Get the Type
- You can get the data type of a variable with the type() function.
type(x)

# Single or Double Quotes?
String variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes:
x = "John"
x = 'John'

# Case-Sensitive
Variable names are case-sensitive.
a = 4
A = "4"
